    "context": "Female is a gender. It is the sex that produces ova (\"egg\" cells) for sexual reproduction. Females of some species also bear offspring.Ayers, Donald M. 1986. English words from Latin and Greek elements. 2nd ed, University of Arizona Press. When looking at seed plants, the plants that only produce seed are called female, those that only produce pollen are called male. The majority of seed plants produce both, and are called hermaphrodite. Organisms can either be grouped as male or female. Female humans are called women and their bodies are different from male humans (who are called men). A woman has a vagina between her legs (a male has a penis) which is the main sexual organ. They also have breasts with milk glands, which allow them to nurse (feed) infants. A woman's shoulders are usually not as wide as a man's, but women usually have wider hips than men, because they need wide hips to be able to give birth. Women who become pregnant are encouraged by doctors to seek professional care from an obstetrician or a gynecologist in order to prevent problems. Likewise, women should see a gynecologist often for routine screening exams for cancer. == Related pages == * Sex determination - the biological process which determines the sex of an individual. == References == ==Other websites== Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Gender"
