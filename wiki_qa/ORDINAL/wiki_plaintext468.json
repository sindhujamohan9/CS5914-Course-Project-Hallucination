    "context": "March is the third month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between February and April. It has 31 days. March is named after Mars, the Roman god of war. March always begins on the same day of the week as November, and additionally, February in common years. March always ends on the same day of the week as June. == The month == In ancient Rome, March was called Martius. It was named after the war god (Mars) and the Romans thought that it was a lucky time to begin a war. Before Julius Caesar's calendar reform, March was the first month of the year in the Roman calendar, as the winter was considered to be a monthless period. It is one of seven months to have 31 days. March begins on the same day of the week as February in common years and November every year, as each other's first days are exactly 4 weeks (28 days) and 35 weeks (245 days) apart respectively. March ends on the same day of the week as June every year, as each other's last days are exactly 13 weeks (91 days) apart. In common years, March starts on the same day of the week as June of the previous year, and in leap years, September and December of the previous year. In common years, March finishes on the same day of the week as September of the previous year, and in leap years, April and December of the previous year. In years immediately before common years, March starts on the same day of the week as August of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, May of the following year. In years immediately before common years, March finishes on the same day of the week as August and November of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, May of the following year. In leap years, the day before March 1 is February 29. This determines the position of each day of the year from there on. As an example, March 1 is usually the 60th day of the year, but in a leap year is the 61st day. In terms of seasons, March is one of two months to have an equinox (the other is September, its seasonal equivalent in both hemispheres), with daylight and darkness of roughly the same number of hours, halfway between the December and June solstices. In the Northern Hemisphere, spring starts in this month, while it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. == Start of the season == The official start of either season is March 1, though the equinox can fall on March 20 or 21, occasionally on March 19. The northern spring equinox marks the start of the Iranian New Year and Baha'i New Year. It is from the March 21 date that Easter's date is calculated, on the Sunday after the first full moon in spring, meaning it can fall between March 22 and April 25 in Western Christianity. == Events in March == === Fixed events === * March 1 - Saint David's Day (Wales) * March 1 - March 1st Movement Memorial Day (South Korea) * March 1 - Beer Day (Iceland) * March 1 - Independence Day (Bosnia and Herzegovina) * March 2 - Independence Day (Morocco) * March 2 - Texas Independence Day * March 2 - jana day (Algeria) * March 2 - Peasants Day (Burma) * March 3 - Hinamatsuri, Girls' Day (Japan) * March 3 - Liberation Day (Bulgaria) * March 3 - Mother's Day (Georgia) * March 3 - Sportsmen's Day (Egypt) * March 3 - Martyrs' Day (Malawi) * March 4 - Saint Casimir's Day (Poland and Lithuania) * March 5 - Custom Chief's Day (Vanuatu) * March 5 - Lei Feng Day (China) * March 5 - National Tree Planting Day (Iran) * March 5 - Saint Piran's Day (Cornwall) * March 6 - Independence Day (Ghana) * March 6 - Alamo Day (Texas) * March 6 - Foundation Day (Norfolk Island) * March 7 - Felicity and Perpetua (Roman Catholicism) * March 7 - Teachers' Day (Albania) * March 8 - International Women's Day * March 9 - Teachers' Day (Lebanon) * March 10 - Tibetan Uprising Day (Supporters of Tibetan Independence) * March 11 - Re-establishment of Independence (Lithuania) * March 11 - Moshoeshoe Day (Lesotho) * March 11 - Johnny Appleseed Day (United States) * March 12 - National Day of Mauritius * March 12 - Youth Day (Zambia) * March 14 - Pi Day * March 14 - Mother Tongue Day (Estonia) * March 14 - White Day (Japan and Korea) * March 15 - National Day of Hungary * March 15 - Holiday in Liberia, celebrating its first President, Joseph Jenkins Roberts * March 15 - Honen Matsuri (Japan) * March 16 - Saint Urho's Day (Finnish Communities in Canada and the US) * March 16 - Latvian Legion Day * March 16 - Day of the Book Smugglers (Lithuania) * March 17 - Saint Patrick's Day, celebrating Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland * March 19 - Saint Joseph's Day (Roman Catholicism) * March 19 - Unity Day (Kashubia, northern Poland) * March 20/21 - Equinox, northern Spring, southern Autumn * March 20/21 - Iranian New Year * March 20 - Independence Day (Tunisia) * March 20 - Francophone Day * March 21 - Baha'i New Year * March 21 - Independence Day (Namibia) * March 21 - Benito Juarez' Birthday (Mexico) * March 21 - World Poetry Day * March 21 - Youth Day (Tunisia) * March 21 - Harmony Day (Australia) * March 21 - Human Rights Day (South Africa) * March 21 - World Down syndrome Day * March 22 - World Water Day * March 22 - Emancipation Day (Puerto Rico) * March 22 - Day of the People's Party (Laos) * March 23 - Republic Day (Pakistan) * March 23 - Polish-Hungarian Friendship Day * March 23 - Family Day (South Africa) * March 24 - World Tuberculosis Day * March 24 - Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice (Argentina) * March 25 - Independence Day (Greece) * March 25 - Maryland Day * March 25 - Mother's Day (Slovenia) * March 25 - Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholicism), also known as Lady Day, old New Year in some European countries * March 26 - Independence Day (Bangladesh) * March 26 - Prince Kuhio Day (Hawaii) * March 26 - Prophet Zoroaster's Birthday (Zoroastrianism) * March 26 - Day of Democracy (Mali) * March 28 - Serfs Emancipation Day (Tibet) * March 28 - Teachers' Day (Czech Republic and Slovakia) * March 29 - Boganda Day (Central African Republic) * March 29 - Youth Day (Republic of China) * March 31 - Cesar Chavez Day (United States) * March 31 - Freedom Day (Malta) === Moveable events === * On a Sunday between March 1 and April 4, Mother's Day is celebrated in the UK. * Lent and Easter- related observances in Western Christianity. **Shrove Monday - between February 2 and March 8 **Shrove Tuesday (Pancake Day) - between February 3 and March 9 **Ash Wednesday, start of Lent - between February 4 and March 10 **Palm Sunday, start of Holy Week - between March 15 and April 18 **Maundy Thursday - between March 19 and April 22 **Good Friday - between March 20 and April 23 **Easter occurs on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 (note: In Eastern Christianity, Easter falls between April 4 and May 8). **Easter Monday - between March 23 and April 26 * Jewish Passover coincides with Christian Holy Week, earliest run is March 15 to March 22, latest run is April 18 to April 25. * Commonwealth Day (second Monday in March) * Canberra Day (Second Monday in March) * Daylight Saving Time **Canada and the United States start Daylight Saving Time on the second Sunday in March.
