    "context": "Newcastle United Football Club is an English football club in Newcastle upon Tyne. Newcastle play in the Premier League. In the 2008/09 season they were relegated after 16 years in the top flight, but won promotion back into the Premier League by winning the Football League Championship. In the 2015/16 season, they were relegated again. == History == Newcastle United was formed in 1892 after the two rival clubs Newcastle West End and Newcastle East End grouped together. They have played their matches at the ground St.James' Park ever since. This ground holds 52,000 people, and is one of the biggest in England. It is located just inside the centre of Newcastle. Newcastle originally played in red shirts and white shorts. In fact, there was a kit clash in their very first League match, away to the then-named Woolwich Arsenal. The home side wore red, so Newcastle played in their change kit of black and white stripes. A permanent switch to black and white soon followed, most likely to reduce kit clashes, and perhaps as a further attempt to appease West End fans. The decision was taken in 1894, as the minutes from the club meeting reveal: \u2018It was agreed that the Club\u2019s colours should be changed from red shirts and white knickers to black and white shirts (two inch stripe) and dark knickers.\u2019. On the 24th day of May 2009 which was also the last day of the season, Newcastle were relegated to the second tier of English football, the Coca-Cola Championship. They returned to the top flight of English football, winning the Championship in the 2009/10 season. In the 2010/11 season, they finished mid-table. The club then went on to finish 5th place in the 2011/12 season. On 17 July 2019, former Sunderland manager Steve Bruce was made manager on a three-year contract. Bruce oversaw 13th and 12th-placed finishes during his first two seasons in charge, both of which were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On 7 October 2021, after 14 years as owner, Ashley sold the club to a new group of owners. The group was made up of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, RB Sports & Media and PCP Capital Partners. == The club == Traditionally the loudest support for the club came from the Gallowgate End - a stand in St. James' Park. This stand is where Alan Shearer once used to watch Newcastle play when he was a child. The record transfer fee the club has paid is \u00a317 million (around $30 million) for Michael Owen, in August 2005. Alan Shearer was the previous record transfer at \u00a315 million, which was also the world's largest transfer fee when he signed in 1996. The Newcastle United's number 9 shirt is one of the most famous shirts in the world. Legends such as Hughie Gallacher, Malcolm McDonald, Jackie Milburn and Alan Shearer have worn the famous shirt. == League position == Season League Position 2000/01 Premier League 11th 2001/02 Premier League 4th 2002/03 Premier League 3rd 2003/04 Premier League 5th 2004/05 Premier League 14th 2005/06 Premier League 7th 2006/07 Premier League 13th 2007/08 Premier League 12th 2008/09 Premier League 18th 2009/10 League Championship Champions 2010/11 Premier League 12th 2011/12 Premier League 5th 2012/13 Premier League 16th 2013/14 Premier League 10th 2014/15 Premier League 15th 2015/16 Premier League 18th 2016/17 League Championship Champions 2017/18 Premier League 10th 2018/19 Premier League 13th 2019/20 Premier League 13th 2020/21 Premier League 12th === Former position === ==References== Category:Premier League clubs Category:Newcastle upon Tyne Category:1892 establishments in England"
