        "answer": "Distance is a scalar that measures how far one thing is from another, it can be measured along any path. Displacement is a vector that measures distance with a straight line and in only one path, and is the shortest way to travel the distance."

    "answers": [
        "Distance can be calculated along any path while displacement is measured with a straight line",
        "Displacement measures the shortest way to travel the distance, while distance can be measured through any path",
        "Distance is a scalar, it measures how far one thing is from another. Displacement on the other hand is a vector that measures this with a straight line",
        "Distance can be measured in any way, but displacement measures the shortest path",
        "Pythagorean theorem is often used in the calculation of distance",
        "Distance is a scalar quantity that measures the space between two things along any path, while displacement measures this distance along a straight line and is a vector",
        "To measure distance you can follow any path, but displacement only considers the straight line distance",
        "Distance is the measure of how far one thing is from another, while displacement measures the shortest possible path to travel this distance",
        "Displacement is a vector that measures the shortest path between two points, while distance can be measured on any path",
        "Distance and displacement are different, with distance being a scalar measurement and displacement being a vector that measures the shortest path between two points"

    "context": "Distance is how far one thing is from another thing. It is also a measure of the space between two things. It can be measured along any path. Thus, someone who goes around in a circle has traveled a distance, even though his position has not changed. In geometry, the distance between two points A and B is sometimes written as \\overline{AB}. Pythagorean theorem is often used in the calculation of distance. Distance is a scalar, and thus is different from displacement. Displacement is a vector that measures distance with a straight line (and in only one path). Displacement is the shortest way to travel the distance. == Examples == * One ball is 5 feet from another ball. The distance between the two balls is 5 feet. * John walks at a speed of 6 kilometres per hour for one hour. John walks a distance of 6 kilometres. * A circle is a curved line. Each point on the circle is the same distance from the centre of the circle. == Related pages == * Euclidean distance * Norm (mathematics) == References == Category:Physical quantity Category:Mathematics Category:Geometry"
